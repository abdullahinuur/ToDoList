This is a ToDoList created using Vanilla JS, HTML and CSS.

You can use npm install to install the required modules.

You can create a project on the left-hand side and click the name to open that project. Projects can be edited and deleted.

On the right-hand side, you can create items to add to the currently open project.

In the centre, the currently open project will be shown, along with all its items. Items can be edited and deleted. You can tick an item to indicate that it is complete, which will grey it out.

Your projects and their items are stored using localStorage, transforming projects and items into JSON format, so the next time you open the ToDoList, they will be recreated.
